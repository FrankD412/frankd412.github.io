Outline



Things that bother millennials:
- Stagnant culture and policies
     - Leverage the perspective of new employees because they come in with fresh eyes. They can more honestly tell you what is wrong with your culture.
     - NEVER fault a new employee for offering criticism, because they are not jaded or biased to the faults in your organization
- A system that combats change
     - Ageism and denial
     - Lack of advancement for excellence
         - the notion of "serving your time"
         - a lack of focus on how something is done
            - Prioritization of the fact that some capability is done versus how.
            - The fundamental lack of understanding of a value proposition
     - Discrimination against "disruptive" ideas
     - The "requirement" to know how to play politics
- The lack of actual leadership
     - Denial of the problem ("this is just how it is")
     - The lack of mentorship
     - A lack of empathy and understanding
     - The lack of backbone (problem avoidance)
