One of the things I've been doing lately is trying to learn more about [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics). While I didn't get a degree in Physics or work in the field of Planetary Science, it's something that's been consistently in my to-learn list. In the last few months, I've picked up [Kerbal Space Program]() again and decided to do my best to make the most of it. As part of this blog, I've decided to try and consolidate my learnings in a way that I can easily go back and reference, but also in hopes that some folks out there on the internet might find it useful.

So without further ado, the first Kerbal blog post is about achieving what are called [synchronous orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_orbit). An object is considered to be in synchronous orbit if it's <a class="tooltip">orbital period<span class="tooltiptext">{{ site.data.orbital_definitions.orbital_period }}</span></a> is equal to the a single rotation of the

Let \\( F_G \\) be the gravitational force between two objects and is mathematically defined as:<br/>
\\[ F_G = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]
Let \\( F_c \\) be the centripetal force of an object and is mathematically defined as:<br/>
\\[ F_c = \frac{m_2 \vee^2}{r} \\]
Let \\( r \\) be the radius between the two gravitationally attracted objects.<br/>
Let \\( m_1 \\) be the mass of a planet, sun, or other celestial object.<br/>
Let \\( m_2 \\) be the mass of the orbiting object (such as a satellite).<br/>
