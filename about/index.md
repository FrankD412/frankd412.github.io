## About me
If I had to describe myself in the broadest of terms, it'd be a nerd, Software Engineer, and science enthusiast. In more specific terms, I am:

* A Software Engineer, Architect, and Designer who is passionate about enabling others
* Dog dad to an adorable Dachshund-mix named Rey
* A Millennial with a strong sense of idealism and optimism
* A lifelong learner and teacher
* Die-hard Star Wars fan

I'm a firm believer that vision and ideals should come before implementation, for one has already compromised quality by sacrificing direction. Even further, while each experience is different, there is something to be said for maintaining your own core principles -- after all, a fresh perspective and a strong sense of self are invaluable tools when faced with new experiences.

And finally, above all else -- always seek to do better than you did yesterday. Each day is a learning experience, and the lessons of today are the foundations of a better tomorrow and even greater next week, month, and year.
