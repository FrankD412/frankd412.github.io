## Current Experience
I currently work as a Project Lead, Computer Scientist, and Software Engineer at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) in the areas of HPC simulation, simulation management, and software workflow automation. My primary roles are:

+ Project Lead and author of the Maestro Workflow Conductor, a Python command line tool and library for specifying, automating, and monitoring software workflows. For more information checkout the Maestro GitHub [page]](https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf) and my associated [project page]({{ site.url }}/maestro-workflow-conductor/).

+ Workflow Computer Science expert for the RAS protein pilot project (one of three pilots of [JDACS4C](https://datascience.cancer.gov/collaborations/joint-design-advanced-computing)). Our mission aims at scaling molecular dynamics to long enough timescales to better understand the RAS protein and its role in the development of cancer. Our team has successfully run large scale MD simulation campaigns on Sierra, the second fastest supercomputer on the [TOP500 list](https://www.top500.org/lists/2018/11/) (as of November 2018). As part of an interdisciplinary team of scientists, my responsibilities include managing the project's code repositories, providing guidance on workflow/code design, and implementing new features.

## Interests and Past Experience

My technical interests include (but are not limited to) Software Engineering, Software Design, Computer Architecture, simulation, simulation and software automation, Object-Oriented Design, Python, and HPC. I initially started with an interest in Computer Architecture, which led me to become a Performance Architect at Intel Corporation. My experiences at Intel maintaining simulators, running large numbers of simulations, and using the results to make architectural assessments allowed me to appreciate the software systems required to perform computational studies. Through these experiences I broadened my interests to simulation software workflows, co-designing and implementing Study Launcher, a workflow launcher that utilized an XML specification. In May 2016, I joined [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) as a Computer Scientist and workflow expert.
